# Data Services TODO

## Big Picture

- [ ] Make consistent:
  - [ ] Tests
    - [ ] Integration tests for the real data, e.g. so if we change, for
          example, the sort order of columns and the associataed getter
          functions, we can be sure we didn't break any implied associations.
    - [ ] Unit tests for the data services, e.g. to test the business logic of
          the getter functions.
  - [ ] Error handling
  - [ ] Logging
  - [ ] Documentation

- [ ] Implement getting data from the database.
  - [ ] Stats
  - [ ] Phenotype
  - [ ] Nomaly variant data
